<h1>EVE Online map application for iOS devices</h1>

<p>A team project for the iOS Developer course by <a href="http://opiframe.com" title="Opiframe">Opiframe</a>. The code is in Swift 4. Xcode version is 9.2.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>
This application requires at least 2GB of RAM to work properly on a hardware device.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
This application has the following features:

<ul>
<li>Zoomable map of the EVE Online universe (can be reset)
<ul>
<li>Note that the zoom reset icon (R) appears only after zoom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Search systems by name</li>
<li>Route plotter from one system to another (requires internet connection)</li>
<li>Displays systems, system details, connections to other systems, regions, and constellations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third party stuff used and other things</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

<p>
While everything works in various simulators, hardware is a different story, however. For example, fifth generation iPad and iPhone SE work, while iPhone 8 does not, due to insufficient memory. In order to get around this, the application needs refactoring. The source code is provided here for users to tinker as much as they want.
